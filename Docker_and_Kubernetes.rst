Docker
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good links:

The 3 following resources form a series very simple to follow and reproduce, and very useful to grab basic concepts:

- https://mlinproduction.com/docker-for-ml-part-1/ : this basically shows how to run jupyter notebook from a docker image. 

- https://mlinproduction.com/docker-for-ml-part-2/ : this shows how to build a docker image.

- https://mlinproduction.com/docker-for-ml-part-3/ : this shows an example of ML sklearn model packed in a docker image.
